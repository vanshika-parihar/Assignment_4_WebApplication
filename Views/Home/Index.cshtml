        <h1 style="text-align:center">Crime statistics in U.S.</h1>
        <p>
            Crime in the United States has been recorded since colonization. Crime rates have varied over time, with a sharp rise after 1900, reaching a broad bulging peak between
            the 1970s and early 1990s. Since then, crime has declined significantly and remains moderate at best nationwide, with such crime rates continuing such a decline to this
            day. Since 1994 crime rates have steadily decreased, before rising up after 2015 until 2018. From 2018 to 2019, crime rates have recontinued at a steady decline. Statistics
            on specific crimes are indexed in the annual Uniform Crime Reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and by annual National Crime Victimization Surveys by the
            Bureau of Justice Statistics
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the primary Uniform Crime Report known as Crime in the United States, the FBI publishes annual reports on the status of law
            enforcement in the United States. The report's definitions of specific crimes are considered standard by many American law enforcement agencies. According to the FBI, index
            crime in the United States includes violent crime and property crime. Violent crime consists of five criminal offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery,
            aggravated assault, and gang violence; property crime consists of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson.

        <h3 style="text-align:center">Purpose of this Site</h3>
        <p>
            Since 1930, the FBI has been collecting data on the types, amounts, and impact of crime in the United States through the Uniform Crime Reporting Program. This program is
            the most reliable source of crime statistics for law enforcement administration, operation, and management. It is also used by researchers, politicians, and criminal
            justice professionals to gain a deeper understanding of crime and society. The purpose of this site is to get a closer look at how crime statistics are used and why
            they are important.

            <h2>Property Crime Data</h2>
            <p>
                Property crime is a category of crime, usually involving private property, that includes, among other crimes, burglary, larceny, theft, motor vehicle theft, arson,
                shoplifting, and vandalism. Property crime is a crime to obtain money, property, or some other benefit. This may involve force, or the threat of force, in cases like
                robbery or extortion. Since these crimes are committed in order to enrich the perpetrator they are considered property crimes. Crimes against property are divided into
                two groups: destroyed property and stolen property. When property is destroyed, it could be called arson or vandalism. Examples of the act of stealing property is
                robbery or embezzlement.Property crimes are high-volume crimes, with cash, electronics (e.g. televisions), power tools, cameras, and jewelry often targeted.
                "Hot products" tend to be items that are concealable, removable, available, valuable, and enjoyable, with an ease of "disposal" being the most important characteristic.

            <p>
                According to a 2013 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), between 2005 and 2012,
                the average homicide rate in the U.S. was 4.9 per 100,000 inhabitants compared to the average rate globally,
                which was 6.2. However, the U.S. had much higher murder rates compared to four other selected "developed countries"
                , which all had average homicide rates of 0.8 per 100,000. In 2004, there were 5.5 homicides for every 100,000 persons
                , roughly three times as high as Canada (1.9) and six times as high as Germany and Italy (0.9).
